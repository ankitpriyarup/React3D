# Overview
React 3D is a test game engine written in modern openGL entirely focussed to cover fundamental mechanics of a Game Engine from scratch. The source code contains a Visual Studio Project.

So far this project is able to perform different shading techniques - unlit, diffuse, specular & bumped with multiple light sources varying types (point, directional & spot light) along with a skybox and basic movement controls.
